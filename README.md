# Automated-Car-Parking-Assistant-Software
The Car Parking Assistant Software could be used for residential buildings, hotels, offices, shopping centers, show rooms, universities, government buildings, airports, hospitals, and stadiums. The advantages of the Car Parking Allotment Software are efficient usage of spaces, slots, display of proper directions, automatic allotment of slots, and display of empty and filled parking slots. This proposed system is especially designed for private parking spaces. Infra-red Sensors are mounted in parking slots, the entrance and the exit. As soon as the car enters, the driver gets information about the filled slots and empty slots on the big display board. As the driver moves further, he will get a message of the allotted parking slot and navigation for the respective slot on the same display board. When all slots are full, “No slots available” message displays on the display board.
